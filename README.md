# Project to be returned

Emmanuel (or Emmanuelle your choice) Dupret contacted the agency   
in which you work because it has had a project in mind for several   
years now. Currently a budget controller for the public sector,   
Emmanuel is passionate about pastry making and would one day want   
to become a pastry critic. In the meantime, he / she wants to start   
a site that will act as a blog to post reviews, recipes, get in   
touch or even allow users to suggest their recipes and share their passion.
For now, he / she would like to obtain the home page or home page   
of the site first, if the result is satisfactory, then your agency   
will continue the work. Be careful however, pastry chefs are often   
in their kitchen, so this page will have to be adapted to smartphones,   
tablets or PC so that you can follow them in all their carbohydrate   
adventures!
The graphic designer of your agency is very busy but he still had   
the time to carry out a very detailed zoning of the home page based   
on customer requests. He offers you a smartphone, tablet and PC   
version that you will have to respect. However, you are free to   
integrate the design you want as long as it remains modern and   
highlight the content of the page.
